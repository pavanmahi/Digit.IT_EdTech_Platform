Digit.It - EdTech Learning Task Manager
Project Overview
Build a full-stack EdTech Learning Task Manager called "Digit.It" that manages the Student-Teacher relationship with role-based access control for learning tasks.
Tech Stack Requirements

Frontend: React
Backend: Node.js with Express
Database: MongoDB with Mongoose
Authentication: JWT with bcrypt password hashing

Database Schema
Users Collection

_id: ObjectId (primary key)
email: String (unique, required)
passwordHash: String (hashed with bcrypt)
role: String (enum: "student" or "teacher")
teacherId: ObjectId (required for students, references a teacher user)

Learning Tasks Collection

_id: ObjectId (primary key)
userId: ObjectId (references the user who created the task)
title: String (required)
description: String (required)
dueDate: Date (optional)
progress: String (enum: "not-started", "in-progress", "completed")
createdAt: Date (auto-generated timestamp)

Backend API Requirements
Authentication Endpoints

POST /auth/signup

No authentication required
Validate input using Joi or express-validator
If role is "student", teacherId must be provided and valid
Hash password with bcrypt before storing
Return success message (no JWT on signup)


POST /auth/login

No authentication required
Implement rate limiting
Validate credentials and return JWT token
Include user role and ID in JWT payload



Task Endpoints (All require JWT authentication)

GET /tasks

Students: Return only their own tasks
Teachers: Return tasks they created + all tasks from their assigned students
Implement query logic to handle teacher-student associations


POST /tasks

Create new task with userId set to logged-in user's ID
Validate all required fields
Return created task object


PUT /tasks/:id

Allow updating title, description, dueDate, and progress
Only task owner (userId matches logged-in user) can update
Return updated task


DELETE /tasks/:id

Only task owner can delete
Return success confirmation



Middleware Requirements

Authentication Middleware: Verify JWT token on protected routes
Authorization Middleware: Check role-based permissions for task access
Error Handling Middleware: Centralized error handler returning consistent JSON format: { success: false, message: "error description" }
Validation Middleware: Input validation for all request bodies and parameters

Frontend Requirements
Pages to Build

Signup Page

Email, password, role selection (student/teacher)
If student selected, show teacher selection dropdown (fetch teachers list)
Form validation before submission


Login Page

Email and password fields
Store JWT token in localStorage on successful login


Dashboard Page (Protected Route)

Display user role and assigned teacher name/ID (for students)
Task list showing: title, description, due date, progress status
Add new task button with form (title, description, optional due date)
Progress dropdown for each task (not-started, in-progress, completed)
Delete button for each task
Filter tasks by progress state (dropdown or tabs)
Logout button that clears localStorage



Frontend Features

Persist authentication using localStorage
Protect dashboard route - redirect to login if no token
Display appropriate tasks based on user role
Clear error messages for failed operations
Loading states for API calls

Security & Quality Requirements

Hash all passwords with bcrypt (minimum 10 rounds)
Validate JWT tokens on all protected routes
Implement input validation on both frontend and backend
Use meaningful variable names and add comments for complex logic (especially authorization checks)
Implement proper error handling with consistent error response format
Prevent unauthorized access through proper middleware checks

Access Control Rules

Students: Can only view, create, update, and delete their own tasks
Teachers: Can view all tasks from their assigned students and tasks they created, but can only update/delete tasks they personally created
Teacher-Student Association: Every student must be assigned to a teacher during signup

Mandatory Deliverables

GitHub repository with /client and /server folders
README.md including:

Setup instructions for both frontend and backend
Environment variables needed
Explanation of role-based access implementation
AI assistance disclosure section
Known issues and improvement suggestions


Multiple meaningful git commits showing development progression

Optional Bonus Features (Choose one if time permits)

Date filtering: Show tasks due this week or overdue tasks
Pagination for teacher's task view (if more than 10 tasks)
Responsive UI using Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap
Deployment on Render

Application Theme
Use a modern educational technology theme with a clean, professional interface suitable for academic task management. The application name "Digit.It" should be prominently displayed.
Critical Notes

Every student MUST have a teacherId assigned during signup
Teachers can view their students' tasks but can only modify their own created tasks
Implement proper JWT verification before processing any task operations
Use Mongoose ObjectId references correctly for relationships
Handle edge cases like invalid ObjectIds, missing required fields, and unauthorized access attempts
RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
